A two-part system that integrates Claude Code CLI with Zed editor for AI-assisted coding.

![File Selection Demo](docs/file-select.png)

## Current Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Text Selection Sharing**: Zed can send selected text context to Claude Code CLI
- **File Reference Handling**: Selected code snippets and file paths are transmitted
- **WebSocket Communication**: Stable connection between Zed and Claude Code CLI

### üöß Limitations
- **LSP Diagnostics**: Currently NOT implemented - Zed extension works as LSP client but doesn't expose IDE diagnostic information (errors, warnings, type hints) to Claude Code CLI
- **One-way Communication**: Primary flow is Zed ‚Üí Claude Code; limited Claude Code ‚Üí Zed capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Zed editor
- Claude Code CLI

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/claude-code-zed.git
   ```

2. **Install the Zed extension** (Development Mode):
   - Open Zed editor
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows) to open the command palette
   - Type "zed: install dev extension" and select it
   - Navigate to and select the `claude-code-extension` folder in your cloned repository
   - The extension will be installed and activated automatically

3. **The claude-code-server is automatically downloaded**:
   - The extension will automatically download the appropriate `claude-code-server` binary from GitHub releases
   - No manual build or installation of the server is required
   - The server binary is cached in the extension's working directory

### Supported Platforms
- **macOS**: Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (aarch64)
- **Linux**: x86_64
- **Windows**: Not currently supported

### Language Server Activation

The Claude Code extension runs as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server and automatically activates when you open files with the following extensions:

- **Rust** (`.rs`)
- **JavaScript** (`.js`)
- **TypeScript** (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- **Python** (`.py`)
- **Markdown** (`.md`)

#### Adding Support for Other File Types

To enable Claude Code integration for additional file types, edit the `claude-code-extension/extension.toml` file:

```toml
[language_servers.claude-code-server]
name = "Claude Code Server"
languages = ["Rust", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python", "Markdown", "Go", "Java"]

[language_servers.claude-code-server.language_ids]
"Rust" = "rust"
"JavaScript" = "javascript"
"TypeScript" = "typescript"
"Python" = "python"
"Markdown" = "markdown"
"Go" = "go"
"Java" = "java"
```

After modifying the configuration, reinstall extention and restart Zed for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, follow these steps to connect Claude Code CLI with Zed:

### Connecting Claude Code to Zed

1. **Open a supported file in Zed**: Create or open a file with one of the supported extensions (`.rs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.md`)

2. **Start Claude Code CLI**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   claude-code
   ```

3. **Enable IDE integration**: In Claude Code CLI, run:
   ```
   /ide
   ```

4. **Select the integration**: Choose `claude-code-server` from the menu that appears

5. **Test the connection**:
   - Select some text in your Zed editor
   - In Claude Code CLI, ask: "What did I select?"
   - If connected properly, Claude should be able to see your selected text

### What to Expect

Once connected, you'll have:
- **Text selection sharing**: Selected text in Zed is automatically available to Claude Code CLI
- **File context**: Claude can see which file you're working in
- **Real-time updates**: Changes in your selection are immediately reflected in Claude

### Verifying the Connection

To confirm everything is working:
- Check for a lock file at `~/.claude/ide/[port].lock`
- The Claude Code CLI will display IDE integration status
- Text selections in Zed should be visible to Claude Code CLI

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites for Development

- **Rust toolchain** with `wasm32-wasi` target:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  rustup target add wasm32-wasi
  ```
- **Zed editor** for testing
- **Claude Code CLI** for integration testing
- **Make** (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)

### Quick Development Workflow

The easiest way to develop and test changes:

1. **Make your changes** to the server code in `claude-code-server/src/`

2. **Build and deploy in one command:**
   ```bash
   make dev-build
   ```

3. **Restart Zed** to use the updated binary

4. **Test your changes** (optional guided testing):
   ```bash
   make dev-test
   ```

### Available Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dev-build` | Build release version and deploy to Zed |
| `make dev-debug` | Build debug version and deploy to Zed |
| `make dev-clean` | Remove development deployment |
| `make dev-test` | Build, deploy, and show testing instructions |
| `make status` | Show current deployment status |
| `make help` | Show all available commands |

### Development Workflow Details

The Makefile automatically:
- Detects your platform (macOS Intel/ARM, Linux)
- Builds the server with the correct target
- Creates the Zed extension directory if needed
- Copies the binary with the platform-specific name
- Provides clear feedback and next steps

### Development Mode Configuration

By default, the extension uses production behavior (downloads from GitHub releases). For developers who want to test local changes, you can enable development mode via the `FORCE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` flag in `claude-code-extension/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
// Set this to true to always use local development binaries instead of GitHub releases
// DEFAULT: false (production behavior - downloads from GitHub)
const FORCE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE: bool = false;
```

**When `FORCE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE = false` (DEFAULT):**
- ‚úÖ Standard production behavior
- ‚úÖ Downloads official binaries from GitHub releases
- ‚úÖ Only uses development binaries in `claude-code-zed` project directories
- ‚úÖ Safe for end users and most development work

**When `FORCE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE = true` (DEVELOPMENT):**
- Extension always looks for manually copied binaries first
- Works in any directory (not just claude-code-zed projects)
- Allows using local fixes immediately without waiting for releases

**To enable development mode:**
1. Edit `claude-code-extension/src/lib.rs`
2. Change `FORCE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` to `true`
3. Restart Zed (the extension will recompile automatically)
4. Use `make dev-build` to deploy your local binary

### Example Development Session
```bash
# Check current status
make status

# Make changes to claude-code-server/src/lsp.rs
# Build and deploy
make dev-build

# Restart Zed and test
make dev-test
```

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Build the server
cd claude-code-server
cargo build --release

# Copy to Zed extension directory (macOS ARM example)
cp target/release/claude-code-server \
  "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions/work/claude-code-zed/claude-code-server-macos-aarch64"
```

### Troubleshooting Development Issues

**"Binary not found" after `make dev-build`:**
- Ensure Zed was completely restarted
- Check `make status` to verify deployment
- Try `make dev-clean && make dev-build`

**Extension compilation errors:**
- Verify Rust toolchain: `rustup target list --installed | grep wasm32-wasi`
- Update Rust: `rustup update`
- Clear Zed cache and reinstall extension

**Connection issues:**
- Check file type is supported (`.rs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.md`)
- Look for "Claude Code Server" in Zed's language server status
- Restart both Zed and Claude Code CLI

## Architecture Overview

This project consists of two components:

### 1. Zed Extension (`claude-code-zed`)
- **Purpose**: Zed editor integration and LSP communication
- **Technology**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Editor selection tracking
  - File reference handling
  - LSP server lifecycle management
  - Communication with the companion server

### 2. Claude Code Server (`claude-code-server`)
- **Purpose**: WebSocket server for Claude Code CLI communication
- **Technology**: Native Rust application
- **Responsibilities**:
  - WebSocket server on localhost
  - Lock file management (`~/.claude/ide/[port].lock`)
  - Authentication token handling
  - JSON-RPC protocol implementation
  - Bridging between Zed extension and Claude Code CLI

## How It Works

The system implements the Claude Code protocol as documented in [claudecode.nvim PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/coder/claudecode.nvim/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md):

### Communication Flow

1. **Zed Extension Startup**:
   - Extension loads in Zed's WASM environment
   - Establishes LSP connection to companion server
   - Begins tracking editor selections and file changes

2. **Companion Server Launch**:
   - `claude-code-server` starts as native process
   - Creates WebSocket server on random port (10000-65535)
   - Writes discovery lock file to `~/.claude/ide/[port].lock`
   - Sets environment variables (`CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`, `ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION`)

3. **Claude Code Discovery**:
   - Claude Code CLI discovers server via lock file
   - Authenticates using UUID token from lock file
   - Establishes WebSocket connection

4. **Bidirectional Communication**:
   - **Zed ‚Üí Claude**: Selection changes, file references via LSP ‚Üí Server ‚Üí WebSocket
   - **Claude ‚Üí Zed**: MCP tool calls via WebSocket ‚Üí Server ‚Üí LSP ‚Üí Extension

### Messages from Zed to Claude Code

- `selection_changed`: Notifies Claude when text selection changes

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: I'm getting a "Failed to compile Rust extension" error when installing

**A:** This error typically occurs when Zed cannot compile the Rust extension to WebAssembly. Here are the solutions:

#### Solution 1: Ensure you have the required Rust toolchain
Make sure you have Rust installed with the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```bash
# Install Rust if you haven't already
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add the WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

#### Solution 2: Install the extension through Zed's extension manager (Recommended)
Instead of installing from source, try installing the published extension:

- Open Zed editor
- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows) to open the command palette
- Type "zed: install dev extension" and select it
- Navigate to and select the `claude-code-extension` folder in your cloned repository
- The extension will be installed and activated automatically

#### Solution 3: Manual compilation check
If you need to install from source, verify the extension compiles correctly:

```bash
cd claude-code-extension
cargo check --target wasm32-wasi
```

If this fails, check that your Rust toolchain is up to date:
```bash
rustup update
```

#### Solution 4: macOS-specific installation using Homebrew
For macOS users who encounter issues with the standard Rust installation, use Homebrew:

```bash
# Install rustup through Homebrew
brew install rustup-init

# Run rustup-init to complete the installation
rustup-init

# Add Cargo bin directory to your PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Add the WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

After installation, restart your terminal and try installing the Zed extension again.

#### Solution 5: Clear Zed's extension cache
Sometimes clearing the extension cache helps:

1. Close Zed completely
2. Remove the extension cache (location varies by OS):
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/zed/extensions`
3. Restart Zed and try installing again

### Q: The extension installs but doesn't seem to work

**A:** Check the following:

1. **Verify the extension is active**: Look for "Claude Code Server" in Zed's language server status
2. **Check supported file types**: The extension only activates for `.rs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, and `.md` files
3. **Restart Zed**: Sometimes a restart is needed after installation
4. **Check logs**: Open Zed's developer console to see any error messages

### Q: How can I see debug logs from the extension?

**A:** To view detailed debug logs from the Claude Code extension:

1. **Start Zed with the `--foreground` flag**:
   ```bash
   zed --foreground .
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code CLI** in another terminal:
   ```bash
   claude-code
   ```

3. **Enable IDE integration**:
   ```
   /ide
   ```

4. **Select `claude-code-server`** from the menu

When running Zed with `--foreground`, you'll see real-time debug output from the extension in your terminal, including:
- Extension initialization messages
- LSP server startup logs
- Connection status messages
- Selection change events
- Communication between Zed and Claude Code CLI
- Any errors or warnings

This is particularly useful for troubleshooting connection issues or understanding the extension's behavior.

### Q: How do I know if Claude Code CLI is connected?

**A:** When properly connected, you should see:

1. A lock file created at `~/.claude/ide/[port].lock`
2. The Claude Code CLI will show IDE integration status
3. Text selections in Zed will be visible to Claude Code CLI
